Sunshine
========

Sunshine is the companion Android app for the Udacity course [Developing Android Apps: Android Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853).

This is the third version of the Sunshine code which I have written following the course.

It's a weather app which shows two week forecast result of weather in a city that the user has chosen,
using the OpenWeatherMap API. It also has settings for switching temperature units from Imperial to
Metric. The user can also open up a map through the app to display the current city, whose weather
report is being shown. On clicking one of the forecasts, a detailed weather report is displayed
(Including humidity, wind speed & direction, pressure, etc.)

#Fundamental Concepts Involved 
Connecting app with cloud i.e. Networking, JSON parsing, Using background threads, Activity life cycles, Databases, Content Providers (even made one for the app), Cursor Adapters and Loaders, Designing menu items and working with Shared Preferences and
ShareActionProviders, Implicit intents, Broadcast receivers and their application, etc.
